# verilog-support.vim #

This is a vim plugin that is heavily based on perl-support by Wolfgang Mehner. I've followed his architecture and a lot of his code structure to add similar support for UVM on SystemVerilog.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.
